# Advent Of Code

My [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) adventures.

the files named like `day_xx.js` contain daily quiz solutions as they were born -
quick and dirty - with no afterwards-makeup.
Sometimes a `day_xx.nice.js` is there, though.

The track record:

* `day 04:` joined the races, with just 80 hrs of delay 🐌🐌🐌
* `day 05:` feeling sooo competent 😎
* `day 06:` made _a lot_ of horrible typos... all the time!
* `day 07:` met something like never before - but I made it - yay! 🙃.
* `day 08:` lost 4 hours, sleeping well. Quiz was not too hard, but on part #2,<br />
   I got stuck at my _"super-simple"_ solution for way too long.
* `day 09:` I _hate_ numbers - I always did!
* `day 10:` Almost flunked the part#2, wasting several hours trying to apply a tree traversal
approach that was inadequate. The right solution was much simpler. But, I still hate numbers. 😝
* `day 11:` I love simulations! Lost some time because of invalid looping condition (a typo).
