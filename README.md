# Advent Of Code

Joined the [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) races, with just 80 hrs of delay ;)

This repo uses semantic versioning in yy.yy.d format.

the files named like `day_xx.js` contain daily quiz solutions as they were born -
quick and dirty - with no afterwards-makeup.
Sometimes a `day_xx.nice.js` is there, though.

My personal progress:

* `day 06:` made _a lot_ of horrible typos... all the time!
* `day 07:` met something like never before - but I made it - yay! ;).
* `day 08:` lost 4 hours, sleeping well. Quiz was not too hard, but on part #2,<br />
I got stuck at my _"super-simple"_ solution for way too long.

**Here** is the _big picture_ snapshot at the time I finished:
