# Advent Of Code

Joined the [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) races, with just 80 hrs of delay ;)

This repo uses semantic versioning in yy.yy.d format.

The dayly quizes solutions are kept in files named like 'day_01.js'.

The files are not edited afterwards - just as dirty as they were born in the heat of the race ;)
