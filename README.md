# Advent Of Code

My [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) adventures.

the files named like `day_xx.js` contain daily quiz solutions as they were born -
quick and dirty - with no afterwards-makeup.
Sometimes a `day_xx.nice.js` is there, though.

### Diary

* `day 04:` joined the races, with just 80 hrs of delay 🐌🐌🐌
* `day 05:` feeling sooo competent 😎
* `day 06:` made _a lot_ of horrible typos... all the time!
* `day 07:` met something like never before - but I made it - yay! 🙃.
* `day 08:` lost 4 hours, sleeping well. Quiz was not too hard, but on part #2,<br />
 I got stuck at my _"super-simple"_ solution for way too long.
* `day 09:` I _hate_ numbers - I always did!
* `day 10:` Almost flunked the part#2, wasting several hours trying to apply a tree traversal
approach that was inadequate. The right solution was much simpler. But, I still hate numbers. 😝
* `day 11:` I love simulations! Lost some time because of invalid looping condition (a typo).
* `day 12:` I was about to go nuts! The puzzle #1 solution worked w example data; but with real data I received:
"Wrong answer! Curiously enough, this is correct answer for somebody else - make sure you
logged in with right account!" After losing an insane amount of time, I finally figured out
there was a tiny error in my ingenious direction computing ([day_12.1.js](day_12.1.js) line 40,41).
This clearly shows, how even testing your code won't guarantee it's correct. 

### Track record
My ranking placements and final times for puzzle 1 and 2 by days. The '_%_'
column shows the ratio of people done both puzzles, from all participants,
by the time I finished the puzzle #2. Of course the time zone difference gives us
the Europeans (and Africans, too) an unfair advantage here. 😜
